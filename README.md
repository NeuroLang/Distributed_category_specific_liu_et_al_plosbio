#Meta analysis scripts for Liu et al. Brain-wide Decoding of Numbers and Letters: Converging Evidence from Multivariate fMRI Analysis and Probabilistic Meta-Analysis

## To run the scripts
If you have the [uv tool](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) installed :

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/NeuroLang/Distributed_category_specific_liu_et_al_plosbio.git`
2. On the repository folder run the command: `uv sync`
3. Run the scripts:
   1. `uv run scripts/forward_meta_analysis.py`
   2. `uv run scripts/reverse_meta_analysis.py`

You should then find in the output folder the resulting files and illustrations from the meta-analyses.
